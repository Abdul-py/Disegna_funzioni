# HY 👋

Funzioni is a respository that I used to do my math homeworks.  

## 🗒️ Objective

For the homework I needed to draw about 8 different functions using Excel.   
I decided to do it in python because I wanted to learn more about it, and also because I wanted to do it in a more efficient way considering that I had to do it 8 times.

## 📚 Libraries

For this project I used the following libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SymPy
