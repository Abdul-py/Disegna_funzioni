Funzioni is a respository that I used to do my math homeworks.  

## 🗒️ Objective

For the homework I needed to draw about 8 different functions using Excel.   
I decided to do it in python because I wanted to learn more about it, and also because I wanted to do it in a more efficient way considering that I had to do it 8 times.

## 📚 Libraries

For this project I used the following libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SymPy

## 📝 How to use

To use this project you need to have python installed on your computer.  
Then you need to install the libraries listed above.

## User input

The user can input the following parameters:

- Type of function
- The equation of the function in this format: `f(x) = x**2 + 3*x + 1`

## 📊 Output

The output is a graph of the function that the user inputted.
